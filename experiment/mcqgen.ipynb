The risk is highest when people are in close proximity, but small airborne particles containing the virus can remain suspended in the air and travel over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur when people touch their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus. People remain contagious for up to 20 days and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms.[23]\\n\\nTesting methods for COVID-19 to detect the virus's nucleic acid include real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTâ€‘PCR),[24][25] transcription-mediated amplification,[24][25][26] and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RTâ€‘LAMP)[24][25] from a nasopharyngeal swab.[27]\\n\\nSeveral COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and distributed in various countries, many of which have initiated mass vaccination campaigns. Other preventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, use of face masks or coverings in public, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. While drugs have been developed to inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is still symptomatic, managing the disease through supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.\",\n",
